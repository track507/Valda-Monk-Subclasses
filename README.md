# Valda-Monk-Subclasses

This file adds the Monk subclasses from Valda's Spire of Secrets to MPMB's Character Creation sheet. This can be used as is or can be added to the main VSoS script found [here](https://pastebin.com/0CdaqJs5).
If you are wanting to use this script along with the main script, please do the following:
- Remove the "SourceList" entry from this script

This script was made due to an original request by Luminous Newt on Discord, and I decided to script all the monk classes from that. 

If there are any grammatical errors or if this script returns an error please DM trackatnite on Discord
